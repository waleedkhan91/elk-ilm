# ELK stack demonstration with ILM.

This demonstrates ELK flow while utilizing elasticsearch cluster and kibana on elastic cloud and running filebeats and logstash on local server.

By the time you see this, my trial version will be expired. So create your own free trial deployment on elastic cloud to complete this example.

Also I have used my own IP address in filebeat.yml and my credentials of free trial in elastic cloud.

Feel free to drop me an email if you have any questions.

Cheers !!!
